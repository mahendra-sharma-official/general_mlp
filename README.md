# general_mlp
General Multilayer Perceptron

# Workflow
create the model
train

# Current Features
1. Has predict function so that once you train it can be used to try some other data, Predict will return the predicted output (dimension of the output is based on the dimension of the last layer)
2. Learning rate and epoch are manually given with train function, so optimization can be done of choice by adding your own or modifying the existing file to include some optimizers (eg : Adam, RMSProp, etc)
3. Separate class for dataset and activation/loss functions, so can add your own or modify the existing ones

# Note
1. I am creating this for learning prupose and documenting my work
